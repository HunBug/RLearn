## Data loading

```{r}
library(caret)
tr <- read.csv("pml-training.csv",header=T)
t <- read.csv(file="pml-testing.csv",header=T)
```

## Exploratory
Checking data
```{r}
str(t)
```

## Training
It is easy to see, that there is many many columns in training/test setts without data and with NA-s. There are many columns with factor data with no useful infromation. The first several columns also useless in prediction since they are only identifiers and meta data.
From the rest i chose randomly because i don't have enough RAM to cumpute all the predictors.

```{r}
m <- train(classe~.,data=tr[,c(37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,8,9,10,160)],method="rpart")
```

RPART method is used because this was the fastest algorithm.

## Evaulating

```{r}
v <- predict(m,newdata=t)
v
```
